    abstract = {Blood glucose ({BG}) is usually measured after a caloric restriction of at least 8 h; however evidence-based recommendations for the duration of a fasting status are missing. Here we analyze the effect of fasting duration on levels of {BG} to determine the minimal fasting duration to achieve comparable {BG} levels to conventional fasting measurements. We used data of a cross-sectional study on primary care patients, performed in October 2005. We included 28,024 individuals (age-range 18–99 years; 63\% women) without known diabetes mellitus and without missing data for {BG} and fasting status. We computed general linear models, adjusting for age, sex, time of blood withdrawal, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, total- and {HDL}-cholesterol, physical activity, smoking, intake of beta-blocker and alcohol. We tested the intra-individual variability with respect to fasting status. Overall, the mean {BG} differed only slightly between individuals fasting ≥8 h and those fasting {\textless}8 h (men: 5.1 ± 0.8 mmol/L versus 5.2 ± 1.2 mmol/L; women: 4.9 ± 0.7 mmol/L, 5.0 ± 1.0 mmol/L). After 3 h of fasting differences of {BG} diminished in men to −0.08 mmol/L (95\%-{CI}: −0.15; −0.01 mmol/L), in women to −0.07 mmol/L (−0.12; −0.03 mmol/L) compared to individuals fasting ≥8 h. Noteworthy, age, time of day of blood withdrawal, physical activity, and intake of hard liquor influenced {BG} levels considerably. Our data challenge the necessity for a fasting duration of ≥8 h when measuring blood glucose, suggesting a random sampling or a fasting duration of 3 h as sufficient. Rather, our study indicates that essentially more effort on the assessment of additional external/internal factors on {BG} levels is necessary.},

    abstract = {Measurement of glycated hemoglobin ({HbA}1c) has been the traditional method for assessing glycemic control. However, it does not reflect intra- and interday glycemic excursions that may lead to acute events (such as hypoglycemia) or postprandial hyperglycemia, which have been linked to both microvascular and macrovascular complications. Continuous glucose monitoring ({CGM}), either from real-time use ({rtCGM}) or intermittently viewed ({iCGM}), addresses many of the limitations inherent in {HbA}1c testing and self-monitoring of blood glucose. Although both provide the means to move beyond the {HbA}1c measurement as the sole marker of glycemic control, standardized metrics for analyzing {CGM} data are lacking. Moreover, clear criteria for matching people with diabetes to the most appropriate glucose monitoring methodologies, as well as standardized advice about how best to use the new information they provide, have yet to be established. In February 2017, the Advanced Technologies \& Treatments for Diabetes ({ATTD}) Congress convened an international panel of physicians, researchers, and individuals with diabetes who are expert in {CGM} technologies to address these issues. This article summarizes the {ATTD} consensus recommendations and represents the current understanding of how {CGM} results can affect outcomes.},

    abstract = {Obesity is a complex multifactorial disease. The worldwide prevalence of overweight and obesity has doubled since 1980 to an extent that nearly a third of the world's population is now classified as overweight or obese. Obesity rates have increased in all ages and both sexes irrespective of geographical locality, ethnicity or socioeconomic status, although the prevalence of obesity is generally greater in older persons and women. This trend was similar across regions and countries, although absolute prevalence rates of overweight and obesity varied widely. For some developed countries, the prevalence rates of obesity seem to have levelled off during the past few years. Body mass index ({BMI}) is typically used to define overweight and obesity in epidemiological studies. However, {BMI} has low sensitivity and there is a large inter-individual variability in the percent body fat for any given {BMI} value, partly attributed to age, sex, and ethnicity. For instance, Asians have greater percent body fat than Caucasians for the same {BMI}. Greater cardiometabolic risk has also been associated with the localization of excess fat in the visceral adipose tissue and ectopic depots (such as muscle and liver), as well as in cases of increased fat to lean mass ratio (e.g. metabolically-obese normal-weight). These data suggest that obesity may be far more common and requires more urgent attention than what large epidemiological studies suggest. Simply relying on {BMI} to assess its prevalence could hinder future interventions aimed at obesity prevention and control.},

    abstract = {Obesity, one of the most prevalent health problems in the Western world, is a chronic and progressive condition. Therefore, as with other chronic diseases, patients with obesity require lifelong treatment. Long-term efficacy and effectiveness of obesity treatments is notoriously poor. This may in part be attributable to the substantial barriers that undermine long-term obesity management strategies. These can include lack of recognition of obesity as a chronic condition, low socioeconomic status, time constraints, intimate saboteurs, and a wide range of comorbidities including mental health, sleep, chronic pain, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive and endocrine disorders. Furthermore, medications used to treat some of these disorders may further undermine weight-loss efforts. Lack of specific obesity training of health professionals, attitudes and beliefs as well as coverage and availability of obesity treatments can likewise pose important barriers. Health professionals need to take care to identify, acknowledge and address these barriers where possible to increase patient success as well as compliance and adherence with treatments. Failure to do so may further undermine the sense of failure, low self esteem and self efficacy already common among obese individuals. Addressing treatment barriers can save resources and increase the prospect of long-term success.},

This review summarizes the evidence from rigorous randomized trials (9 lifestyle trials, 5 drug trials, and 2 surgical trials) on the efficacy and risk- benefit profile of lifestyle, drug, and surgical interventions aimed at promoting sustained (= 2 years) reductions in weight. Both lifestyle and drug interventions consistently produced an approximate 7-lb (3.2-kg) weight loss that was sustained for 2 years and was associated with improvements in diabetes, blood pressure, and/or cardiovascular risk factors. Surgical interventions have a less solid empirical base but offer promise for the promotion of significant and sustained weight reduction posttreatment in the morbidly obese but with possible significant short-term side effects. In summary, there is strong and consistent support from rigorous randomized trials that lifestyle or drug interventions result in modest weight loss with minimal risks but disproportionate clinical benefit. Combinations of lifestyle, drug, and, where appropriate, surgical interventions may be the most efficacious approach to achieving sustained weight loss for the widest diversity of patients.

Progressively more accurate and precise, reasonably unobtrusive, small, comfortable, user-friendly devices connect to the Internet to share information and are sine qua non for a closed-loop artificial pancreas. {CGM} can inform, educate, motivate, and alert people with diabetes. {CGM} is medically indicated for patients with frequent, severe, or nocturnal hypoglycemia, especially in the presence of hypoglycemia unawareness. Surprisingly, despite tremendous advances, utilization of {CGM} has remained fairly limited to date. Barriers to use have included the following: (1) lack of Food and Drug Administration approval, to date, for insulin dosing (“nonadjuvant use”) in the United States and for use in hospital and intensive care unit settings; (2) cost and variable reimbursement; (3) need for recalibrations; (4) periodic replacement of sensors; (5) day-to-day variability in glycemic patterns, which can limit the predictability of findings based on retrospective, masked “professional” use; (6) time, implicit costs, and inconvenience for uploading of data for retrospective analysis; (7) lack of fair and reasonable reimbursement for physician time; (8) inexperience and lack of training of physicians and other healthcare professionals regarding interpretation of {CGM} results; (9) lack of standardization of software methods for analysis of {CGM} data; and (10) need for professional medical organizations to develop and disseminate additional clinical practice guidelines regarding the role of {CGM}. Ongoing advances in technology and clinical research have addressed several of these barriers. Use of {CGM} in conjunction with an insulin pump with automated suspension of insulin infusion in response to actual observed or predicted hypoglycemia, as well as progressive refinement of closed-loop systems, is expected to dramatically enhance the clinical utility and utilization of {CGM}.},

    To analyze the effects of a long-term intensive lifestyle intervention including high-intensity interval training ({HIIT}) and Mediterranean diet ({MedD}) counseling on glycemic control parameters, insulin resistance and β-cell function in obese subjects.
    Methods
    The glycemic control parameters (fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin), insulin resistance, and β-cell function of 72 obese subjects (54 women; mean age=53±9years) were assessed at baseline and upon completion of a 9-month intensive lifestyle intervention program conducted at the cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation center of the Montreal Heart Institute, from 2009 to 2012. The program included 2–3 weekly supervised exercise training sessions ({HIIT} and resistance exercise), combined to {MedD} counseling.
    Results
    Fasting plasma glucose ({FPG}) (mmol/L) (before: 5.5±0.9; after: 5.2±0.6; P{\textless}0.0001), fasting insulin (pmol/L) (before: 98±57; after: 82±43; P=0.003), and insulin resistance, as assessed by the {HOMA}-{IR} score (before: 3.6±2.5; after: 2.8±1.6; P=0.0008) significantly improved, but not {HbA}1c (\%) (before: 5.72±0.55; after: 5.69±0.39; P=0.448), nor β-cell function ({HOMA}-β, \%) (before: 149±78; after: 144±75; P=0.58).

              To assess the validity of using fasting plasma glucose ({FPG}) concentrations in conjunction with {HbA}1c or fructosamine for the screening of diabetes in high-risk individuals.
            
            
              {RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}
              In this study 2,877 Hong Kong Chinese (565 [19.6\%] men; 2,312 [80.4\%] women) with various risk factors for glucose intolerance underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test ({OGTT}) for screening of diabetes. The risk factors included a family history positive for diabetes, a history of gestational diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, and obesity.
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              Using World Health Organization ({WHO}) criteria, 1,593 (55.4\%) had normal glucose tolerance, 657 (22.8\%) had impaired glucose tolerance, and 627 (21.8\%) had diabetes. When the 1997 American Diabetes Association ({ADA}) criteria were applied, 394 (13.7\%) had diabetes with an {FPG} ≥ 7.0 mmol/l. Using multiple receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the paired values of an {FPG} of 5.6 mmol/l and a {HbA}1c of 5.5\% gave an optimal sensitivity of 83.8\% and specificity of 83.6\% to predict a 2-h plasma glucose ({PG}) ≥ 11.1 mmol/l. Likewise, the paired values of an {FPG} of 5.4 mmol/l and a fructosamine level of 235 mumol/l (n = 2,408) gave an optimal sensitivity of 81.5\% and specificity of 83.2\%. An {FPG} ≥ 5.6 mmol/l and an {HbA}1c ≥ 5.5\% was 5.4-fold more likely to occur in diabetic subjects (based on the {WHO} criteria) compared with nondiabetic subjects. For paired parameters less than these values, the likelihood ratio of this occurring in diabetic subjects was only 0.11. Similarly, an {FPG} ≥ 5.4 mmol/l and a fructosamine ≥ 235 μmol/l was fivefold more likely to occur in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects, with both parameters less than these values having a likelihood ratio of 0.04. Using these paired values as initial screening tests, only subjects who had an {FPG} ≥ 5.6 mmol/l and \&lt; 7.8 mmol/l and a fructosamine ≥235 μmol/1 (n = 526) required {OGTT} to confirm diabetes, meaning that 78.2\% [(2,408 – 526)/2,408] of the {OGTTs} could have been saved. Based on the 1997 {ADA} criterion of an {FPG} cutoff value of 7.0 mmol/1, the corresponding numbers of {OGTTs} to be saved were 82.6\% and 85.5\%, respectively.
            
            
              {CONCLUSIONS}
              The paired values of {FPG} and {HbA}1c or {FPG} and fructosamine helped to identify potentially diabetic subjects, the diagnosis of which could be further confirmed by the 75-g {OGTT}. Using this approach ∼ 80\% of {OGTTs} could have been saved, depending on the diagnostic cutoff value of {FPG}.},

    abstract = {An estimated 72.5 million American adults are obese, and the growing {US} obesity epidemic is responsible for substantial increase in morbidity and mortality, as well as increased health care costs. Obesity results from a combination of personal and societal factors, but is often viewed as a character flaw rather than a medical condition. This leads to stigma and discrimination towards obese individuals and decreases the likelihood of effective intervention. Conditions related to obesity are increasingly common, such as metabolic syndrome, impaired fasting glucose ({IFG}) and impaired glucose tolerance ({IGT}), all of which indicate high risk for type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This paper reviews the progression from obesity to diabetes, identifying physiological changes that occur along this path as well as opportunities for patient identification and disease prevention. Patients with prediabetes (defined as having {IFG}, {IGT} or both) and/or metabolic syndrome require interventions designed to preserve insulin sensitivity and ?-cell function, both of which start to deteriorate prior to T2DM diagnosis. Lifestyle modification, including both healthy eating choices and increased physical activity, is essential for weight management and diabetes prevention. Although sustained weight loss is often considered by patients and physicians as being impossible to achieve, effective interventions do exist. Specifically, the Diabetes Prevention Program ({DPP}) and programs modelled along its parameters have shown repeated successes, even with long-term maintenance. Recent setbacks in the development of medications for weight loss further stress the importance of lifestyle management. By viewing obesity as a metabolic disorder rather than a personal weakness, we can work with patients to address this increasingly prevalent condition and improve long-term health outcomes.},

    abstract = {Reversal of type 2 diabetes to normal metabolic control by either bariatric surgery or hypocaloric diet allows for the time sequence of underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms to be observed. In reverse order, the same mechanisms are likely to determine the events leading to the onset of hyperglycemia and permit insight into the etiology of type 2 diabetes. Within 7 days of instituting a substantial negative calorie balance by either dietary intervention or bariatric surgery, fasting plasma glucose levels can normalize. This rapid change relates to a substantial fall in liver fat content and return of normal hepatic insulin sensitivity. Over 8 weeks, first phase and maximal rates of insulin secretion steadily return to normal, and this change is in step with steadily decreasing pancreatic fat content. The difference in time course of these two processes is striking. Recent information on the intracellular effects of excess lipid intermediaries explains the likely biochemical basis, which simplifies both the basic understanding of the condition and the concepts used to determine appropriate management. Recent large, long-duration population studies on time course of plasma glucose and insulin secretion before the diagnosis of diabetes are consistent with this new understanding. Type 2 diabetes has long been regarded as inevitably progressive, requiring increasing numbers of oral hypoglycemic agents and eventually insulin, but it is now certain that the disease process can be halted with restoration of normal carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Type 2 diabetes can be understood as a potentially reversible metabolic state precipitated by the single cause of chronic excess intraorgan fat.},

    abstract = {Background: Individuals with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance are at high risk of progression to type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle modification through change to diet and exercise habit has considerable potential to prevent or delay the onset of this disease. Methods: A systematic literature search was undertaken of Medline, {EMBASE}, the Cochrane library and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature for journal articles relevant to the question of whether type 2 diabetes can be prevented by lifestyle change. Results: Four cohort studies in a total of 4864 high risk individuals followed for a period of 2.5–6 years were identified. These showed that lifestyle change may reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes by 28–59\%. Moreover, follow-up studies also indicate that diabetes incidence rates continue to be depressed many years after the discontinuation of a lifestyle intervention. Evidence from a meta-analysis confirms this evidence and suggests that it would be necessary to treat 6.4 (95\% confidence interval 5.0–8.4) individuals to prevent or delay one case of diabetes through lifestyle intervention. An examination of weight loss diets (low fat, high protein or Mediterranean) suggests each may be effective but each has limitations requiring care in food selection. Evidence also suggests that the maintenance of weight loss also requires regular exercise with an additional expenditure of approximately 8.4 {MJ} week−1 (2000 kcal week−1). Conclusions: Diabetes can be prevented by lifestyle change. The challenge is to develop public health approaches to support individuals with respect to incorporating the lifestyle changes needed to reduce the risk of diabetes into their everyday life.},

The epidemic has affected developed and developing countries alike, and the worldwide prevalence of diabetes is projected to increase dramatically by 2025 (3). The increase in type 2 diabetes is related to lifestyle changes that have resulted in overweight, obesity, and decreased physical activity levels. These environmental changes, superimposed on genetic predisposition, increase insulin resistance, which, in concert with progressive β-cell failure, results in rising glycemia in the nondiabetic range. In addition to the risk for diabetes, insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion are accompanied by a host of major cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) risk factors including hypertension and dyslipidemia. Further reduction in insulin secretion over time results in increasing glycemia and the development of diabetes, which in turn is associated with the development of microvascular and cardiovascular complications.},
