    abstract = {Blood glucose ({BG}) is usually measured after a caloric restriction of at least 8 h; however evidence-based recommendations for the duration of a fasting status are missing. Here we analyze the effect of fasting duration on levels of {BG} to determine the minimal fasting duration to achieve comparable {BG} levels to conventional fasting measurements. We used data of a cross-sectional study on primary care patients, performed in October 2005. We included 28,024 individuals (age-range 18–99 years; 63\% women) without known diabetes mellitus and without missing data for {BG} and fasting status. We computed general linear models, adjusting for age, sex, time of blood withdrawal, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, total- and {HDL}-cholesterol, physical activity, smoking, intake of beta-blocker and alcohol. We tested the intra-individual variability with respect to fasting status. Overall, the mean {BG} differed only slightly between individuals fasting ≥8 h and those fasting {\textless}8 h (men: 5.1 ± 0.8 mmol/L versus 5.2 ± 1.2 mmol/L; women: 4.9 ± 0.7 mmol/L, 5.0 ± 1.0 mmol/L). After 3 h of fasting differences of {BG} diminished in men to −0.08 mmol/L (95\%-{CI}: −0.15; −0.01 mmol/L), in women to −0.07 mmol/L (−0.12; −0.03 mmol/L) compared to individuals fasting ≥8 h. Noteworthy, age, time of day of blood withdrawal, physical activity, and intake of hard liquor influenced {BG} levels considerably. Our data challenge the necessity for a fasting duration of ≥8 h when measuring blood glucose, suggesting a random sampling or a fasting duration of 3 h as sufficient. Rather, our study indicates that essentially more effort on the assessment of additional external/internal factors on {BG} levels is necessary.},

    abstract = {Measurement of glycated hemoglobin ({HbA}1c) has been the traditional method for assessing glycemic control. However, it does not reflect intra- and interday glycemic excursions that may lead to acute events (such as hypoglycemia) or postprandial hyperglycemia, which have been linked to both microvascular and macrovascular complications. Continuous glucose monitoring ({CGM}), either from real-time use ({rtCGM}) or intermittently viewed ({iCGM}), addresses many of the limitations inherent in {HbA}1c testing and self-monitoring of blood glucose. Although both provide the means to move beyond the {HbA}1c measurement as the sole marker of glycemic control, standardized metrics for analyzing {CGM} data are lacking. Moreover, clear criteria for matching people with diabetes to the most appropriate glucose monitoring methodologies, as well as standardized advice about how best to use the new information they provide, have yet to be established. In February 2017, the Advanced Technologies \& Treatments for Diabetes ({ATTD}) Congress convened an international panel of physicians, researchers, and individuals with diabetes who are expert in {CGM} technologies to address these issues. This article summarizes the {ATTD} consensus recommendations and represents the current understanding of how {CGM} results can affect outcomes.},

    abstract = {Obesity is a complex multifactorial disease. The worldwide prevalence of overweight and obesity has doubled since 1980 to an extent that nearly a third of the world's population is now classified as overweight or obese. Obesity rates have increased in all ages and both sexes irrespective of geographical locality, ethnicity or socioeconomic status, although the prevalence of obesity is generally greater in older persons and women. This trend was similar across regions and countries, although absolute prevalence rates of overweight and obesity varied widely. For some developed countries, the prevalence rates of obesity seem to have levelled off during the past few years. Body mass index ({BMI}) is typically used to define overweight and obesity in epidemiological studies. However, {BMI} has low sensitivity and there is a large inter-individual variability in the percent body fat for any given {BMI} value, partly attributed to age, sex, and ethnicity. For instance, Asians have greater percent body fat than Caucasians for the same {BMI}. Greater cardiometabolic risk has also been associated with the localization of excess fat in the visceral adipose tissue and ectopic depots (such as muscle and liver), as well as in cases of increased fat to lean mass ratio (e.g. metabolically-obese normal-weight). These data suggest that obesity may be far more common and requires more urgent attention than what large epidemiological studies suggest. Simply relying on {BMI} to assess its prevalence could hinder future interventions aimed at obesity prevention and control.},

    abstract = {Obesity, one of the most prevalent health problems in the Western world, is a chronic and progressive condition. Therefore, as with other chronic diseases, patients with obesity require lifelong treatment. Long-term efficacy and effectiveness of obesity treatments is notoriously poor. This may in part be attributable to the substantial barriers that undermine long-term obesity management strategies. These can include lack of recognition of obesity as a chronic condition, low socioeconomic status, time constraints, intimate saboteurs, and a wide range of comorbidities including mental health, sleep, chronic pain, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive and endocrine disorders. Furthermore, medications used to treat some of these disorders may further undermine weight-loss efforts. Lack of specific obesity training of health professionals, attitudes and beliefs as well as coverage and availability of obesity treatments can likewise pose important barriers. Health professionals need to take care to identify, acknowledge and address these barriers where possible to increase patient success as well as compliance and adherence with treatments. Failure to do so may further undermine the sense of failure, low self esteem and self efficacy already common among obese individuals. Addressing treatment barriers can save resources and increase the prospect of long-term success.},

This review summarizes the evidence from rigorous randomized trials (9 lifestyle trials, 5 drug trials, and 2 surgical trials) on the efficacy and risk- benefit profile of lifestyle, drug, and surgical interventions aimed at promoting sustained (= 2 years) reductions in weight. Both lifestyle and drug interventions consistently produced an approximate 7-lb (3.2-kg) weight loss that was sustained for 2 years and was associated with improvements in diabetes, blood pressure, and/or cardiovascular risk factors. Surgical interventions have a less solid empirical base but offer promise for the promotion of significant and sustained weight reduction posttreatment in the morbidly obese but with possible significant short-term side effects. In summary, there is strong and consistent support from rigorous randomized trials that lifestyle or drug interventions result in modest weight loss with minimal risks but disproportionate clinical benefit. Combinations of lifestyle, drug, and, where appropriate, surgical interventions may be the most efficacious approach to achieving sustained weight loss for the widest diversity of patients.

Progressively more accurate and precise, reasonably unobtrusive, small, comfortable, user-friendly devices connect to the Internet to share information and are sine qua non for a closed-loop artificial pancreas. {CGM} can inform, educate, motivate, and alert people with diabetes. {CGM} is medically indicated for patients with frequent, severe, or nocturnal hypoglycemia, especially in the presence of hypoglycemia unawareness. Surprisingly, despite tremendous advances, utilization of {CGM} has remained fairly limited to date. Barriers to use have included the following: (1) lack of Food and Drug Administration approval, to date, for insulin dosing (“nonadjuvant use”) in the United States and for use in hospital and intensive care unit settings; (2) cost and variable reimbursement; (3) need for recalibrations; (4) periodic replacement of sensors; (5) day-to-day variability in glycemic patterns, which can limit the predictability of findings based on retrospective, masked “professional” use; (6) time, implicit costs, and inconvenience for uploading of data for retrospective analysis; (7) lack of fair and reasonable reimbursement for physician time; (8) inexperience and lack of training of physicians and other healthcare professionals regarding interpretation of {CGM} results; (9) lack of standardization of software methods for analysis of {CGM} data; and (10) need for professional medical organizations to develop and disseminate additional clinical practice guidelines regarding the role of {CGM}. Ongoing advances in technology and clinical research have addressed several of these barriers. Use of {CGM} in conjunction with an insulin pump with automated suspension of insulin infusion in response to actual observed or predicted hypoglycemia, as well as progressive refinement of closed-loop systems, is expected to dramatically enhance the clinical utility and utilization of {CGM}.},

    To analyze the effects of a long-term intensive lifestyle intervention including high-intensity interval training ({HIIT}) and Mediterranean diet ({MedD}) counseling on glycemic control parameters, insulin resistance and β-cell function in obese subjects.
    Methods
    The glycemic control parameters (fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin), insulin resistance, and β-cell function of 72 obese subjects (54 women; mean age=53±9years) were assessed at baseline and upon completion of a 9-month intensive lifestyle intervention program conducted at the cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation center of the Montreal Heart Institute, from 2009 to 2012. The program included 2–3 weekly supervised exercise training sessions ({HIIT} and resistance exercise), combined to {MedD} counseling.
    Results
    Fasting plasma glucose ({FPG}) (mmol/L) (before: 5.5±0.9; after: 5.2±0.6; P{\textless}0.0001), fasting insulin (pmol/L) (before: 98±57; after: 82±43; P=0.003), and insulin resistance, as assessed by the {HOMA}-{IR} score (before: 3.6±2.5; after: 2.8±1.6; P=0.0008) significantly improved, but not {HbA}1c (\%) (before: 5.72±0.55; after: 5.69±0.39; P=0.448), nor β-cell function ({HOMA}-β, \%) (before: 149±78; after: 144±75; P=0.58).

              {RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}
              In this study 2,877 Hong Kong Chinese (565 [19.6\%] men; 2,312 [80.4\%] women) with various risk factors for glucose intolerance underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test ({OGTT}) for screening of diabetes. The risk factors included a family history positive for diabetes, a history of gestational diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, and obesity.
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              Using World Health Organization ({WHO}) criteria, 1,593 (55.4\%) had normal glucose tolerance, 657 (22.8\%) had impaired glucose tolerance, and 627 (21.8\%) had diabetes. When the 1997 American Diabetes Association ({ADA}) criteria were applied, 394 (13.7\%) had diabetes with an {FPG} ≥ 7.0 mmol/l. Using multiple receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the paired values of an {FPG} of 5.6 mmol/l and a {HbA}1c of 5.5\% gave an optimal sensitivity of 83.8\% and specificity of 83.6\% to predict a 2-h plasma glucose ({PG}) ≥ 11.1 mmol/l. Likewise, the paired values of an {FPG} of 5.4 mmol/l and a fructosamine level of 235 mumol/l (n = 2,408) gave an optimal sensitivity of 81.5\% and specificity of 83.2\%. An {FPG} ≥ 5.6 mmol/l and an {HbA}1c ≥ 5.5\% was 5.4-fold more likely to occur in diabetic subjects (based on the {WHO} criteria) compared with nondiabetic subjects. For paired parameters less than these values, the likelihood ratio of this occurring in diabetic subjects was only 0.11. Similarly, an {FPG} ≥ 5.4 mmol/l and a fructosamine ≥ 235 μmol/l was fivefold more likely to occur in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects, with both parameters less than these values having a likelihood ratio of 0.04. Using these paired values as initial screening tests, only subjects who had an {FPG} ≥ 5.6 mmol/l and \&lt; 7.8 mmol/l and a fructosamine ≥235 μmol/1 (n = 526) required {OGTT} to confirm diabetes, meaning that 78.2\% [(2,408 – 526)/2,408] of the {OGTTs} could have been saved. Based on the 1997 {ADA} criterion of an {FPG} cutoff value of 7.0 mmol/1, the corresponding numbers of {OGTTs} to be saved were 82.6\% and 85.5\%, respectively.
            
            
              {CONCLUSIONS}
              The paired values of {FPG} and {HbA}1c or {FPG} and fructosamine helped to identify potentially diabetic subjects, the diagnosis of which could be further confirmed by the 75-g {OGTT}. Using this approach ∼ 80\% of {OGTTs} could have been saved, depending on the diagnostic cutoff value of {FPG}.},

    abstract = {An estimated 72.5 million American adults are obese, and the growing {US} obesity epidemic is responsible for substantial increase in morbidity and mortality, as well as increased health care costs. Obesity results from a combination of personal and societal factors, but is often viewed as a character flaw rather than a medical condition. This leads to stigma and discrimination towards obese individuals and decreases the likelihood of effective intervention. Conditions related to obesity are increasingly common, such as metabolic syndrome, impaired fasting glucose ({IFG}) and impaired glucose tolerance ({IGT}), all of which indicate high risk for type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This paper reviews the progression from obesity to diabetes, identifying physiological changes that occur along this path as well as opportunities for patient identification and disease prevention. Patients with prediabetes (defined as having {IFG}, {IGT} or both) and/or metabolic syndrome require interventions designed to preserve insulin sensitivity and ?-cell function, both of which start to deteriorate prior to T2DM diagnosis. Lifestyle modification, including both healthy eating choices and increased physical activity, is essential for weight management and diabetes prevention. Although sustained weight loss is often considered by patients and physicians as being impossible to achieve, effective interventions do exist. Specifically, the Diabetes Prevention Program ({DPP}) and programs modelled along its parameters have shown repeated successes, even with long-term maintenance. Recent setbacks in the development of medications for weight loss further stress the importance of lifestyle management. By viewing obesity as a metabolic disorder rather than a personal weakness, we can work with patients to address this increasingly prevalent condition and improve long-term health outcomes.},

    abstract = {Reversal of type 2 diabetes to normal metabolic control by either bariatric surgery or hypocaloric diet allows for the time sequence of underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms to be observed. In reverse order, the same mechanisms are likely to determine the events leading to the onset of hyperglycemia and permit insight into the etiology of type 2 diabetes. Within 7 days of instituting a substantial negative calorie balance by either dietary intervention or bariatric surgery, fasting plasma glucose levels can normalize. This rapid change relates to a substantial fall in liver fat content and return of normal hepatic insulin sensitivity. Over 8 weeks, first phase and maximal rates of insulin secretion steadily return to normal, and this change is in step with steadily decreasing pancreatic fat content. The difference in time course of these two processes is striking. Recent information on the intracellular effects of excess lipid intermediaries explains the likely biochemical basis, which simplifies both the basic understanding of the condition and the concepts used to determine appropriate management. Recent large, long-duration population studies on time course of plasma glucose and insulin secretion before the diagnosis of diabetes are consistent with this new understanding. Type 2 diabetes has long been regarded as inevitably progressive, requiring increasing numbers of oral hypoglycemic agents and eventually insulin, but it is now certain that the disease process can be halted with restoration of normal carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Type 2 diabetes can be understood as a potentially reversible metabolic state precipitated by the single cause of chronic excess intraorgan fat.},

    abstract = {Background: Individuals with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance are at high risk of progression to type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle modification through change to diet and exercise habit has considerable potential to prevent or delay the onset of this disease. Methods: A systematic literature search was undertaken of Medline, {EMBASE}, the Cochrane library and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature for journal articles relevant to the question of whether type 2 diabetes can be prevented by lifestyle change. Results: Four cohort studies in a total of 4864 high risk individuals followed for a period of 2.5–6 years were identified. These showed that lifestyle change may reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes by 28–59\%. Moreover, follow-up studies also indicate that diabetes incidence rates continue to be depressed many years after the discontinuation of a lifestyle intervention. Evidence from a meta-analysis confirms this evidence and suggests that it would be necessary to treat 6.4 (95\% confidence interval 5.0–8.4) individuals to prevent or delay one case of diabetes through lifestyle intervention. An examination of weight loss diets (low fat, high protein or Mediterranean) suggests each may be effective but each has limitations requiring care in food selection. Evidence also suggests that the maintenance of weight loss also requires regular exercise with an additional expenditure of approximately 8.4 {MJ} week−1 (2000 kcal week−1). Conclusions: Diabetes can be prevented by lifestyle change. The challenge is to develop public health approaches to support individuals with respect to incorporating the lifestyle changes needed to reduce the risk of diabetes into their everyday life.},

The epidemic has affected developed and developing countries alike, and the worldwide prevalence of diabetes is projected to increase dramatically by 2025 (3). The increase in type 2 diabetes is related to lifestyle changes that have resulted in overweight, obesity, and decreased physical activity levels. These environmental changes, superimposed on genetic predisposition, increase insulin resistance, which, in concert with progressive β-cell failure, results in rising glycemia in the nondiabetic range. In addition to the risk for diabetes, insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion are accompanied by a host of major cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) risk factors including hypertension and dyslipidemia. Further reduction in insulin secretion over time results in increasing glycemia and the development of diabetes, which in turn is associated with the development of microvascular and cardiovascular complications.},

    Peritoneal dialysis has a number of complications including increased blood glucose. Although exercise has been suggested to resolve this complication, most patients are not active. The present study aimed at determining the effects of twice-weekly, 40-min sessions of pedaling on a stationary bicycle on mean fasting blood sugar ({FBS}) and 2-h postprandial blood sugar ({PPBS}) among continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.
    
    Materials and Methods:
    In this clinical trial, convenience sampling was used to select 22 patients [age: 51.4 (12.3) years] undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis [mean duration: 12.5 (8.5) months] from university hospitals in Isfahan, Iran. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups (test and control). The test group participated in an 8-week exercise program in which they pedaled a stationary bicycle with an intensity of four on Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion. {FBS} and {PPBS} were measured at baseline and at the end of the 8th and 16th sessions of exercise. Data were analyzed with Student's t-test and repeated measures analysis of variance.
    
    Results:
    After the eighth session, the mean {FBS} and {PPBS} levels were lower in the test group than in the control group. However, the differences were not statistically significant. After 16 sessions of exercise, the mean {FBS} and {PPBS} levels in the intervention group were significantly less than the in control group.
    
    Conclusions:
    Forty minutes of pedaling on a stationary bicycle for two times a week can significantly reduce mean {FBS} and {PPBS} levels in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.},

    abstract = {Background: Glucose sensors measure glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid ({ISF}), remote from blood. {ISF} glucose is well known to be “delayed” with respect to blood glucose ({BG}). However, {ISF} glucose is not simply a shifted-in-time version of {BG} but exhibits a more complex pattern.
    
    Methods: To gain insight into this problem, one can use linear systems theory. However, this may lose a more clinical readership, thus we use simulation and two case studies to convey our thinking in an easier way. In particular, we consider {BG} concentration measured after meal and exercise in 12 healthy volunteers, whereas {ISF} glucose is simulated using a well-accepted model of blood–{ISF} glucose kinetics, which permits calculation of the equilibration time, a parameter characterizing the system. Two metrics are defined: blood and {ISF} glucose difference at each time point and time to reach the same glucose value in blood and {ISF}.
    
    Results: The simulation performed and the two metrics show that the relationship between blood–{ISF} glucose profiles is more complex than a pure shift in time and that the pattern depends on both equilibration time and {BG}.
    
    Conclusions: In this in silico study, we have illustrated, with simple case studies, the meaning of the of {ISF} glucose with respect to {BG}. Understanding that {ISF} glucose is not just a shifted-in-time version but a distorted mirror of {BG} is important for a correct use of continuous glucose monitoring for diabetes management.},

Continuous glucose monitoring ({CGM}) sensors, which monitor glucose concentration in the subcutaneous tissue almost continuously, allowed improving the detection of critical hypo- and hyper-glycemic episodes. Moreover, their integration with insulin pumps for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion allowed developing algorithms that automatically tune insulin dosing based on {CGM} measurements in order to mitigate the incidence of critical episodes. In this work, we aim at reviewing the literature on methods for {CGM}-based automatic attenuation or suspension of basal insulin with a focus on algorithms, their implementation in commercial devices and clinical evidence of their effectiveness and safety.},

    abstract = { Current treatment regiments for individuals depending on exogenous insulin are based on measurements of blood glucose obtained through painful finger sticks. The shift to minimal or noninvasive continuous glucose monitoring primarily involves a shift from blood glucose measurements to devices measuring subcutaneous interstitial fluid (ISF) glucose. As the development of these devices progresses, details of the dynamic relationship between blood glucose and interstitial glucose dynamics need to be firmly established. This is a challenging task insofar as direct measures of ISF glucose are not readily available. The current article investigated the dynamic relationship between plasma and ISF glucose using a model-based approach. A two-compartment model system previously validated on data obtained with the MiniMed Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) is reviewed and predictions from the original two-compartment model were confirmed using new data analysis of glucose dynamics in plasma and hindlimb lymph (lymph is derived from ISF) in the anesthetized dog. From these data sets, the time delay between plasma and ISF glucose in dogs was established (5-12 minutes) and a simulation study was performed to estimate the errors introduced if ISF is taken as a surrogate for blood. From the simulation study, the error component resulting from the differences in plasma and ISF glucose was estimated to be < 6\% during normal day-to-day use in an individual with diabetes (error component calculated as the standard deviation of the ISF/plasma glucose differences under conditions where the maximal time delay was used). This difference is most likely within the variance between arterial and venous blood glucose. We conclude that the differences between plasma and ISF glucose will not be a significant obstacle in advancing the use of ISF as an alternative to blood glucose measurements. }

In order to achieve a stable glucose sensor signal, special attention was paid to the sensor materials and architecture, i.e., biocompatible coating of the sensor, limitation of glucose flux into the working electrode, low oxidation potential by use of manganese dioxide, and a tissue-averaging sensor design. A series of in vitro and in vivo evaluations showed that the sensor enables stable and accurate glucose sensing in the subcutaneous tissue for up to 7 days. Parallel measurements with four sensors in a single patient showed a close agreement between these sensors.

    Continuous glucose monitoring ({CGM}) is today provided by various techniques. This study aims to compare two different {CGM}-systems: the {FreeStyle} Libre subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring system ({SC}-{CGM}) and the Eirus intravascular microdialysis continuous glucose monitoring system ({MD}-{CGM}) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
    
    Methods:
    A total of 26 patients were equipped with both the {SC}-{CGM} and the {MD}-{CGM} systems. The {SC}-{CGM} system was placed subcutaneously in the left upper-arm and the {MD}-{CGM} system was placed in the superior vena cava. Reference blood glucose values were obtained by analyzing arterial blood in a blood gas analyzer. Reference glucose values were then paired with glucose values from both {CGM}-systems and analyzed for accuracy.
    
    Results:
    In all, 514 paired {MD}-{CGM}/arterial blood gas glucose values and 578 paired {SC}-{CGM}/arterial blood gas glucose values were obtained. Mean difference ({SD}) for the {MD}-{CGM} system was 0.9 (15.1) mg/dl and for the {SC}-{CGM} system −43.4 (20) mg/dl. {ISO} criteria ({ISO}15197:2013) were not met by either {CGM} system. In the Clarke error grid, all paired samples were within the zones {AB} for the {MD}-{CGM} system, and 94\% in zone A. For the {SC}-{CGM} system, 99.1\% of the paired samples were within zones {AB}, and 18.9\% in zone A. Both the {MD}-{CGM} and the {SC}-{CGM} systems were reliable and used without complications.
    
    Conclusions:
    These results indicate that the Eirus intravascular microdialysis system monitors glucose continuously with superior accuracy compared to the {FreeStyle} Libre subcutaneous glucose monitoring system, which repeatedly measured a glucose value that was lower than the reference method.},

    abstract = {The dietary recommendations made for carbohydrate intake by many organizations/agencies have changed over time. Early recommendations were based on the need to ensure dietary sufficiency and focused on meeting micronutrient intake requirements. Because carbohydrate-containing foods are a rich source of micronutrients, starches, grains, fruits, and vegetables became the foundation of dietary guidance, including the base of the {US} Department of Agriculture’s Food Guide Pyramid. Dietary sufficiency recommendations were followed by recommendations to reduce cholesterol levels and the risk for cardiovascular disease; reduction in total fat (and hence saturated fat) predominated. Beginning in the 1970s, carbohydrates were recommended as the preferred substitute for fat by the American Heart Association and others to achieve the recommended successive reductions in total fat and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ({LDL}-C). Additional research on fats and fatty acids found that monounsaturated fatty acids could serve as an alternative substitution for saturated fats, providing equivalent lowering of {LDL}-C without concomitant reductions in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increases in triglycerides witnessed when carbohydrates replace saturated fat. This research led to a sharper focus in the guidelines in the 1990s toward restricting saturated fat and liberalizing a range of intake of total fat. Higher-fat diets, still low in saturated fatty acids, became alternative strategies to lower-fat diets. As the population has become increasingly overweight and obese, the emergence of the metabolic syndrome and its associated disruptions in glucose and lipid metabolism has led to reconsiderations of the role of carbohydrate-containing foods in the American diet. Consequently, a review of the evidence for and against high-carbohydrate diets is important to put this controversy into perspective. The current dietary recommendations for carbohydrate intake are supported by the evidence.},

    Background & aims
    This study characterized the glucose and insulin responses to temporal alterations in meal frequency, and alterations in the macronutrient composition.
    Methods
    Eight subjects underwent three separate 12-h meal tests: three high carbohydrate (3CHO) meals, 6 high carbohydrate meals (6CHO), 6 high-protein meals (6HP). Blood samples were taken at 15-min intervals. Integrated area under the curve (AUC) concentrations for glucose and plasma insulin were determined (total, 4-h, and 2-h blocks) for each meal condition.
    Results
    Baseline glucose and insulin values were not different between study days. Peak glucose levels were highest on the 3CHO day; however the 12 h glucose AUC was higher during the 6CHO condition (p = 0.029) than 3CHO condition, with no difference in the insulin response. The 6HP condition resulted in a decreased glucose AUC (p = 0.004) and insulin AUC (p = 0.012) compared to 6CHO.
    Conclusions
    In non-obese individuals, glucose levels remained elevated throughout the day with frequent CHO meals compared to 3CHO meals, without any differences in the insulin levels. Increasing the protein content of frequent meals attenuated both the glucose and insulin response. These findings of elevated glucose levels throughout the day warrant further research, particularly in overweight and obese individuals with and without type 2 diabetes.}

Unpublished data were also included where the data quality could be verified. The data were separated into two lists: the first representing more precise data derived from testing healthy subjects and the second primarily from individuals with impaired glucose metabolism.RESULTS—The tables, which are available in the online-only appendix, list the GI of over 2,480 individual food items. Dairy products, legumes, and fruits were found to have a low GI. Breads, breakfast cereals, and rice, including whole grain, were available in both high and low GI versions. The correlation coefficient for 20 staple foods tested in both healthy and diabetic subjects was r = 0.94 (P \\&lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS—These tables improve the quality and quantity of GI data available for research and clinical practice.}",

    abstract = {Objective
    The association between sleep habits and hemoglobin A1c ({HbA}1c) level has not been sufficiently examined. In the present study of residents in a local community, the associations between sleep duration and {HbA}1c level were examined.
    Methods
    Self-administered questionnaires were mailed to 1062 residents in a rural community in Japan, and completed questionnaires were collected. At the time of collection, the fasting plasma glucose and {HbA}1c levels were measured using peripheral blood samples. For the analyses, values that were considered to represent high levels were a fasting plasma glucose level of ⩾126mg/dl and a {HbA}1c level of ⩾6.5\%. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the associations between sleep duration and high fasting plasma glucose or high {HbA}1c levels.
    Results
    The prevalence of high fasting plasma glucose and high {HbA}1c levels was significantly high (p{\textless}0.01) in subjects with a short or a long sleep duration. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated a significant association between high {HbA}1c level and sleep duration. The adjusted odds ratios for a high {HbA}1c level showed high values with regard to both short and long sleep durations.
    Conclusions
    {HbA}1c level showed a U-shaped association with sleep duration. These results suggest that there may be an appropriate range of sleep duration in individuals with glucose tolerance disorders. It is expected that the present findings will contribute to the treatment and prevention of diabetes mellitus.},

    abstract = {Data for trends in glycaemia and diabetes prevalence are needed to understand the effects of diet and lifestyle within populations, assess the performance of interventions, and plan health services. No consistent and comparable global analysis of trends has been done. We estimated trends and their uncertainties in mean fasting plasma glucose ({FPG}) and diabetes prevalence for adults aged 25 years and older in 199 countries and territories. We obtained data from health examination surveys and epidemiological studies (370 country-years and 2.7 million participants). We converted systematically between different glycaemic metrics. For each sex, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate mean {FPG} and its uncertainty by age, country, and year, accounting for whether a study was nationally, subnationally, or community representative. In 2008, global age-standardised mean {FPG} was 5.50 mmol/L (95\% uncertainty interval 5.37-5.63) for men and 5.42 mmol/L (5.29-5.54) for women, having risen by 0.07 mmol/L and 0.09 mmol/L per decade, respectively. Age-standardised adult diabetes prevalence was 9.8\% (8.6-11.2) in men and 9.2\% (8.0-10.5) in women in 2008, up from 8.3\% (6.5-10.4) and 7.5\% (5.8-9.6) in 1980. The number of people with diabetes increased from 153 (127-182) million in 1980, to 347 (314-382) million in 2008. We recorded almost no change in mean {FPG} in east and southeast Asia and central and eastern Europe. Oceania had the largest rise, and the highest mean {FPG} (6.09 mmol/L, 5.73-6.49 for men; 6.08 mmol/L, 5.72-6.46 for women) and diabetes prevalence (15.5\%, 11.6-20.1 for men; and 15.9\%, 12.1-20.5 for women) in 2008. Mean {FPG} and diabetes prevalence in 2008 were also high in south Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and central Asia, north Africa, and the Middle East. Mean {FPG} in 2008 was lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, east and southeast Asia, and high-income Asia-Pacific. In high-income subregions, western Europe had the smallest rise, 0.07 mmol/L per decade for men and 0.03 mmol/L per decade for women; North America had the largest rise, 0.18 mmol/L per decade for men and 0.14 mmol/L per decade for women. Glycaemia and diabetes are rising globally, driven both by population growth and ageing and by increasing age-specific prevalences. Effective preventive interventions are needed, and health systems should prepare to detect and manage diabetes and its sequelae.},

The apparent sensor sensitivity and {ISF} glucose equilibration delay were estimated on separate days during hyperglycemic clamps in four dogs in which insulin was either suppressed with somatostatin, allowed to change, or increased with an exogenous infusion. A 2-h sensor “settling-in” period was allowed before the clamps. During insulin deficiency, the sensor sensitivity and {ISF} glucose delay were 0.23 ± 0.03 {nA} per mg/dl and 4.4 ± 0.8 min. Sensitivity was not affected by increases in endogenous (0.30 ± 0.04 vs. 0.28 ± 0.04 {nA} per mg/dl) or exogenous insulin (0.18 ± 0.01 vs. 0.16 ± 0.01 {nA} per mg/dl) nor was the delay (3.3 ± 1.2 vs. 5.7 ± 1.1 and 9.2 ± 2.6 vs. 12.3 ± 1.7 min; P {\textgreater} 0.05 for all). Sensor glucose accurately predicted plasma glucose without correcting for delays {\textless}10 min (r {\textgreater} 0.9 for all), whereas for longer delays a digital corrective filter was used (r = 0.91 with filter). We conclude that the relationship between blood and {ISF} glucose is not affected by insulin and that delays in {ISF} glucose equilibration can be corrected with digital filters.},

    abstract = {Objective
    The notion that late evening meal promotes weight gain is popular, and it may also elicit postprandial hyperglycemia, since glucose tolerance decreases during midnight. Diabetic patients with night-eating symptoms, compared with patients without night-eating behaviors, are more likely to be obese and to have elevated A1c. However, epidemiological analysis adjusted for difference in total energy intake did not identify nighttime eating as the risk of obesity. The present study evaluated the effect of a single loading of late evening meal on diurnal variation of blood glucose and 24-h energy expenditure.
    Methods
    Ten young adults stayed twice in a room-size respiratory chamber for 24h, in a randomized repeated-measures design. After the entrance to the chamber at 1700h, the subjects took normal (1900h) or late (2230h) evening meal, breakfast and lunch, and remained in the chamber until 1700h. Time course of blood glucose was measured by continuous glucose monitoring system.
    Results
    Late evening meal enhanced postprandial blood glucose response to the evening meal and the subsequent breakfast. Overall 24h average blood glucose level was also elevated by late evening meal. Late evening meal shifted postprandial increase in energy expenditure toward late at night, but overall 24h energy expenditure remained almost identical in the two dietary conditions.
    Conclusions
    The present study under controlled sedentary condition supports the notion that a single loading of late evening meal enhances average blood glucose over 24h, but does not support that late evening meal reduces 24h energy expenditure.},
