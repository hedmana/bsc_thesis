    abstract = {Blood glucose ({BG}) is usually measured after a caloric restriction of at least 8 h; however evidence-based recommendations for the duration of a fasting status are missing. Here we analyze the effect of fasting duration on levels of {BG} to determine the minimal fasting duration to achieve comparable {BG} levels to conventional fasting measurements. We used data of a cross-sectional study on primary care patients, performed in October 2005. We included 28,024 individuals (age-range 18–99 years; 63\% women) without known diabetes mellitus and without missing data for {BG} and fasting status. We computed general linear models, adjusting for age, sex, time of blood withdrawal, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, total- and {HDL}-cholesterol, physical activity, smoking, intake of beta-blocker and alcohol. We tested the intra-individual variability with respect to fasting status. Overall, the mean {BG} differed only slightly between individuals fasting ≥8 h and those fasting {\textless}8 h (men: 5.1 ± 0.8 mmol/L versus 5.2 ± 1.2 mmol/L; women: 4.9 ± 0.7 mmol/L, 5.0 ± 1.0 mmol/L). After 3 h of fasting differences of {BG} diminished in men to −0.08 mmol/L (95\%-{CI}: −0.15; −0.01 mmol/L), in women to −0.07 mmol/L (−0.12; −0.03 mmol/L) compared to individuals fasting ≥8 h. Noteworthy, age, time of day of blood withdrawal, physical activity, and intake of hard liquor influenced {BG} levels considerably. Our data challenge the necessity for a fasting duration of ≥8 h when measuring blood glucose, suggesting a random sampling or a fasting duration of 3 h as sufficient. Rather, our study indicates that essentially more effort on the assessment of additional external/internal factors on {BG} levels is necessary.},
